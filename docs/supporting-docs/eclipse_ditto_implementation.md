# Integration of Open Source Digital Twin Platform for Real-Time Environmental Monitoring  
**Practical Implementation Guide**

---

## 1. Introduction

Our company uses Thingsboard Community Edition to collect temperature and humidity (T&H) data from devices via Python APIs. Although this setup successfully ingests telemetry data, we currently lack a system to create real-time digital twins for these devices. Specifically, we need to monitor the environmental conditions (temperature and humidity at both the top and bottom of each rack) in our data center. This guide outlines a practical solution using an open source digital twin platform—Eclipse Ditto—to visualize and manage real-time sensor data.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Challenge:**  
Our Thingsboard system collects T&H data, but it does not provide a real-time, visual representation of the environmental conditions of our devices. We need an integrated digital twin solution that:
- Seamlessly connects with Thingsboard via Python APIs.
- Accurately maps sensor data to digital twin models.
- Provides an intuitive dashboard for real-time visualization of temperature and humidity at the top and bottom of each rack.

**Objective:**  
To enhance data center monitoring and enable proactive maintenance by deploying an open source digital twin platform that mirrors physical conditions in real time.

## 3. Proposed Solution Overview

We propose to implement Eclipse Ditto as our open source digital twin platform and integrate it with our existing Thingsboard system. The solution includes:

1. **Platform Selection:**  
   Choose Eclipse Ditto for its robust API support, ease of deployment via Docker, and active community.

2. **Deployment:**  
   Set up Ditto in our server environment and configure it to expose REST APIs.

3. **Digital Twin Modeling:**  
   Define a JSON-based model for each T&H sensor to capture environmental metrics (top and bottom temperature/humidity).

4. **Integration:**  
   Use Thingsboard’s rule engine and Python scripts to forward telemetry data to Ditto via HTTP PATCH requests.

5. **Visualization:**  
   Use tools like Grafana (or Ditto’s built-in console) to create a real-time dashboard that displays sensor data for each device.

6. **Testing and Validation:**  
   Perform pilot testing to ensure data accuracy and system performance before scaling up.

## 4. Detailed Implementation Steps

### 4.1. Research and Platform Selection

- **Action Items:**  
  - Review open source platforms (Eclipse Ditto, alternatives) focusing on features such as real-time data handling, API integration, and Docker deployment.
  - Select Eclipse Ditto as it meets our requirements and has strong community support.

- **Expected Outcome:**  
  A chosen digital twin platform that integrates well with our existing infrastructure.

### 4.2. Setting Up Eclipse Ditto

- **Installation via Docker:**  
  1. **Clone the Repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto.git
     ```
  2. **Navigate to the Docker Compose Directory:**
     ```bash
     cd ditto/docker-compose
     ```
  3. **Deploy Ditto:**
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
     This command starts all required containers, including Ditto’s core services.
  
- **Configuration:**  
  - Ensure the REST API is accessible (e.g., at `http://<ditto-host>:8080/api/2/things`).
  - Configure authentication settings as needed.
  - Validate the installation using curl or Postman:
     ```bash
     curl http://<ditto-host>:8080/api/2/things
     ```

- **Expected Outcome:**  
  A fully operational Eclipse Ditto instance ready to host digital twin models.

### 4.3. Defining Digital Twin Models

- **Design the Model:**  
  Develop a JSON schema that represents the T&H sensor. An example model:
  ```json
  {
    "thingId": "device-001",
    "features": {
      "environment": {
        "properties": {
          "tempTop": 0,
          "tempBottom": 0,
          "humidityTop": 0,
          "humidityBottom": 0
        }
      }
    }
  }
