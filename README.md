# Digital Twin Implementation for Data Center Optimization at ESDS

This repository contains the implementation of a **digital twin solution** designed to optimize data center operations at **ESDS**. By leveraging real-time data, advanced analytics, and machine learning, this project aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and minimize downtime in data center environments.

ESDS, a leading provider of data center solutions, faces critical challenges such as high energy consumption, unplanned equipment failures, reactive monitoring, and limited predictive capabilities. This project addresses these issues by creating a virtual representation of the physical data center, enabling proactive management, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decision-making.
