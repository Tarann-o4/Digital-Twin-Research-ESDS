# Digital Twin Research & Implementation

A repository dedicated to implementing and researching Digital Twin solutions for data center optimization at ESDS. This project integrates Eclipse Ditto—an open source digital twin platform—with Thingsboard’s IoT data collection to enable real-time monitoring, proactive maintenance, and data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to harness Digital Twin technology for data center optimization at ESDS. Currently, our Thingsboard Community Edition collects temperature and humidity (T&H) data via Python APIs, but it lacks real-time digital twin visualization. By integrating Eclipse Ditto, we aim to create virtual replicas of our devices—mirroring environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity at the top and bottom of each rack) in real time. This solution will enhance monitoring, enable predictive maintenance, and drive efficient operations.
